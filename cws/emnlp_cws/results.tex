\section{Results}

Table \ref{tbl:results} shows our empirical results on SIGHAN 2005 dataset. Our dual decomposition method outperforms both the word-based and character-based baselines  consistently across all four subsets in both F$_1$ and \textsc{oov} recall (R$_{\mathrm{oov}}$). Our method demonstrates a robustness across domains and segmentation standards regardless of which baseline model was stronger. Of particular note is DD's is much more robust in R$_{\mathrm{oov}}$, where the two baselines swing a lot. This is an important property for downstream applications such as entity recognition. The DD algorithm is also more consistent, which would likely lead to improvements in applications such as machine translation \cite{Chang:2008:ACL}. 

The improvement over our word- and character-based baselines is also seen in our results on the earlier SIGHAN 2003 dataset.
Table \ref{tbl:comparison} puts our method in the context of earlier systems for CWS. Our method achieves the best reported score on 6 out of 7 datasets.
