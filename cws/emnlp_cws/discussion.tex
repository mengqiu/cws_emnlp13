\section{Discussion}

In this section we talked about detailed consistency analysis and maybe give some examples.
\subsection{Dual decomposition convergence}
Plot the histogram of the number of iterations it takes to converge, and percentage of optimality. 

\subsection{consistency}

give results of the consistency analysis

\subsection{oracle}

Give results of the oracle experiment

\subsection{Error analysis}
Maybe look at cases where the model choose the worse of the two instead of the better of the two. See if there are patterns or insights we can draw. Not very important for a short paper.
